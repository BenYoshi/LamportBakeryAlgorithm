# OSHW3
## Lamport's Bakery Algorithm
### Instructions:
>First HW: 2 barbers, 5 waiting chairs, first check barbers then chairs otherwise leave for some time and comeback.
NO wait or sleep. Use spinlocks - put a empty method inside the while loop that way it will pass control quicker.
Second HW: 10 threads ordered by ID number, lowest to highest, adds 1 to counter waits until everyone is done. 
The next task is to multiply int x = 1 by two, each thread in order.
NO wait or sleep.
